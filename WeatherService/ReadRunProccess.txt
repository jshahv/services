Prefferable Approach During Development

Both approach are good and stable. Maven approach is slighly more config at start to create 
maven build config then Spring Boot App option from IDE
During Development I usuall preffer Spring boot App but that just personnel peference and i have been using IDE
for long time with normal Spring mvc and legacy app so i am more used with that.

Prefferable Approach In Production for Deployment

1) Option 1 - Fat Jar
2) Option 2 - War File

If Organization has set process for Container deployment then fat jar is good option as Spring boot fat jar file
has already production grade tomcat

If Organization has different Appication Server where other application are already being install and its going
to be shared then packaging in war file is better option
